Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: i think that portugal was the wrong predicton after all

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: after one hundred simulation the predicton is usually good enough
